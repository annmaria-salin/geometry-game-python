## Geometry Game
This Python-based geometry game is a fun and interactive way to learn about points, rectangles, and geometric concepts. The game generates a random rectangle and challenges the player to guess whether a given point is inside the rectangle and to estimate the area of the rectangle. It's a great tool for improving geometry knowledge while having fun.

## Features
- Random Rectangle: A random rectangle is generated for each game session with random coordinates.

- Point Guess: Players can guess whether a given point is inside the rectangle.

- Area Estimation: Players can estimate the area of the rectangle.

- Visual Representation: The game provides a visual representation of the rectangle and the guessed point on a canvas using the Turtle graphics library.

## How It Works
Run the script using Python.

- The game generates a random rectangle with random coordinates.

- The player is prompted to guess a point's X and Y coordinates.

- The player is prompted to estimate the area of the rectangle.

- The game provides feedback on whether the point is inside the rectangle and calculates the difference between the estimated and actual rectangle area.

- The visual representation of the rectangle and the guessed point is displayed using Turtle graphics.

- The player can continue to play as many rounds as desired.

## Prerequisites
Before playing the game, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.

- The Turtle graphics library, which is included in Python's standard library.
